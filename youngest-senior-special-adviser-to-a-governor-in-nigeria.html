									O’buchi Multimedia had the privilege of meeting one of Nigeria’s youngest Senior Special Advisor to the Governor of Nasarawa State Nigeria, Mr Ibrahim Abdullhahi who shares a few of his success secrets at a very young age. Ibrahim is a 29 year old Lawyer currently working closly with his Excellency Governor Abdullahi Alhaji Sule to improve on the Investment and Economic Planning aspect of the State.
									</p>
									<p><h6>Good afternoon sir, please can you introduce yourself to us?</h6></p>
									<p>Good afternoon, My name is Ibrahim Abdullahi. I am a lawyer, I practised cooperate and commercial law for a couple of years and now I work in Government as an adviser to the Governor of Nasarawa state on investment and Economic planning, spare heading the Nasarawa Economic development strategy.</p>
									<p><h6>TELL US A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD AND YOUR FAMILY BACKGROUND</h6></p>
									<p>I was born in Abuja, likewise grew up there. I come from a very large family (An extended family) my late grandfather was a monarch, so he really taught us a lot of things about being with people and also being your brother’s keeper. I am driven by my Muslim values.</p>
									<p><h6>TELL US ABOUT YOUR SECONDARY SCHOOL EXPERIENCE</h6></p>
									<p>I went to a secondary school in Abuja called community secondary school Asokoro. I finished there as well. It was a very interesting school. We had a good mix of people from different backgrounds, it was a community of some sought of diplomats, so we had quite a number of our classmates who were very well travelled; it was quite a cosmopolitan setting.</p>
									<p><h6>HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A STUDENT BOTH SOCIALLY AND ACADEMICALLY?</h6></p>
									<p>Maybe I was a socially awkward student, I was one of those that always studied, and I experienced little or no social gathering because I was doing a lot of things. Participating in extra-curricular activities like debates, current affairs and representing school quiz.</p>
									<p><h6>TELL US ABOUT YOUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES (UNIVERSITY)</h6></p>
									<p>I went to a university in England called the University of Redi. It used to be part of the University of Oxford and then it broke out on its own and became a university, I studied law there. Our law school was a very special one, especially with the architectural program. It was very historical, that was in Foxhill house. Studying law there was a very engaging exercise; very few of us were Africans. It was a good and enlightening experience.</p>
									<p><h6>WHAT WERE YOUR MOST MEMORABLE UNIVERSITY MOMENTS</h6></p>
									<p>Going clubbing; when I was in university, I had a bit of balanced Academic and social life, I had good memories of that. I also have fun memories of burning my candles at night, spending the whole night studying or trying to meet a deadline of course work.</p>
									<p><h6>SO DO YOU HAVE A MASTER’S DEGREE?</h6></p>
									<p>No, I don’t have a master’s degree</p>
									<p><h6>WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) AT SOME POINT, TELL US ABOUT IT</h6></p>
									<p>As a young boy, I was president of the children’s parliament. By virtue of that, I became one of the representatives of UNICEF and by extension the UN in Nigeria, so I have been to two UN general assembly meetings to represent Nigeria and Africa, the first was at the age of 15 and the second was about the age of 17.</p>
									<p><h6>TELL US ABOUT YOUR CAREER: BEST PART OF YOUR JOB? FIRST BUSINESS YOU STARTED AND AT WHAT AGE?</h6></p>
									<p>The first business I started was on the university campus with my law school classmates. It was a consultancy research business, though we didn’t really succeed in it, however, it was enlightening. Then, I decided that I was going to go into consulting, which I did when I got back to Nigeria.</p>
									<p>When I got back to law school, I got qualified as a lawyer. I started working at the law firm of Ab Mammud. I did my law school attachment there and subsequently my one year of NYSC service as well. I was also in Dikuo Mammud for a bit and then my boss who eventually became my mentor, also became the president of the bar association and I was appointed to assist him in driving policy in the bar association and I did that for two years and right after then I co-founded a law firm of which I became the Managing Partner for a couple of months until my appointment in Government.</p>
									<p><h6>WHAT WERE THE CHALLENGES OF SETTING UP THIS LAW FIRM?</h6></p>
									<p>Raising capital was a challenge. That is, how to deploy capital the right way. Another big challenge was that we were very young, so it was very hard to convince people to accept and trust in our work and to overlook our age, it was very difficult.</p>
									<p><h6>WHO WAS THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE IN YOUR CAREER?</h6></p>
									<p>I think a number of people. My parents first of all, for giving me the kind of training that I have. Also, career-wise were two gentlemen I met, Gori and Akin. I work with them to date.
									</p><p>Gori really had such an immense impact in my Outlook and my early career days. He led me through getting a career development plan, which still helps me to date. The second person that helped me is Ab Mammud, he was the first employer I ever worked for in Nigeria. He took me everywhere, he gave me major roles to play and this was valuable exposures that helped me a great deal.</p>
									<p><h6>WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE NOT UP TO 30 AND ALREADY SERVING AS SENIOR SPECIAL ADVISER TO THE GOVERNOR OF NASARAWA STATE. WE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT TO THAT POINT AT A VERY YOUNG AGE</h6></p>
									<p>Its luck, I mean, I say this because my faith is strong but you can only be as lucky as your level of preparedness and if I had gotten this job, like five years ago, I probably wouldn’t have been as effective as I am now and I wouldn’t be able to enjoy it.</p>
									<p>So, first of all, I thank God for the kind of opportunities I have gotten in life, I thank the people that I have worked with as a lawyer and at a young age.</p>
									<p>For as far as I can recall, we’ve done a lot of work in this space and I think it’s perhaps a recognition of that and then also it took some level of Grace for the Governor to overlook my age and accepted me regardless. I also thank the governor for finding me worthy of this appointment. It is a rare privilege.</p>
									<p><h6>CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR JOB, WHAT IT IS ABOUT?</h6></p>
									<p>First of all, I am driving our economic development strategy called (NEDS) National Economic Development Strategy. I am also doing deals facilitation and investment promotion for the government; I am also spare- heading our priority projects in the state. I advice the governor the best way I can and ensure to see it become a reality.</p>
									<p><h6>WHAT STRATEGIES HAVE YOU PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE?</h6></p>
									<p>We have a high-level strategy and vision, we also have initiatives under our strategy that we hope to achieve to enable the business environment and make it favourable for Businesses to function in Nasarawa state.</p>
									<p><h6>WHAT KEY CHARACTERS WOULD YOU ATTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF YOUR CARRIER AS A YOUNG PERSON?</h6></p>
									<p>Honesty, confidence, humility and hard work</p>
									<p><h6>WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE TO YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ASPIRE TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS YOU?</h6></p>
									<p>I think that everyone has a part and you just do you. Once you identify your part, something you love to do at your comfort, something that you believe in, pursue it vigorously.</p>
									<p>Skills with a bit of passion just really makes you deliver and also to understand that it could go wrong and it could go well but regardless of what happens, enjoy the process because there is no experience that is wasted, so just be very open-minded. Most importantly be very humble, accept criticisms, learn from every experience, and treat people well. Whoever you come across on your journey is also going through same, everyone is important.</p>
									<p><h6>The last question, how do you spend your time?</h6></p>
									<p>I watch a lot of TV, read some nice books, mostly recommended by my friends. I also play Golf and lately, I added running to my list.</p>
									<p>Thank you very much!</p>
