									<p class="excert">O’Buchi Multimedia Blog Team meet with 3 under 30 Nigerian Cooks serving dishes for top Nigerian brands like Peak Milk, Coca-coca and others.</p>
									<p>Sir, kindly introduce yourself and tell us about your brand</p>
									<p>My name is David Rotimi aka Timsley, I am the CEO of Timsley’s Kitchen. I am from kogi state. I am a chef, I basically cook food for events.</p>
									<p><h6>WHEN DID YOUR PASSION FOR COOKING START?</h6></p>
									<p>I would say I started at home, around age seven. I am the last of seven children, so most times I am always with my mum in the kitchen . Apart from that, I studied tourism, so I had to do Catherine courses and then during service, I was always in the NYSC kitchen, from there I got my first job with Genesis eatery in Port-Harcourt and that’s how I started cooking full-time.</p>
									<p><h6>COMING FROM A WORLD WHERE CULTURE HAS MADE IT SEEM LIKE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT A MAN IS MEANT TO DO, HOW WHERE YOU ABLE TO FIT INTO THIS AND EXCEL IN IT?</h6></p>
									<p>I believe in the 21st century, most of the world best chefs are male, they are exceptional.</p>
									<p>It’s no more something people shy away from, so I think the exposure is there already but you just need to tap into it, so I do it with all sense of reasoning that it’s my passion so I don’t let people talk me down. I am a graduate, so it wouldn’t be because “oh he didn’t go to school that’s why he is cooking” No it’s not possible and then it makes it better when you have an education and you’re doing this because you know all the do’s and don’ts, from food hygiene which would be different from the normal mama-put (roadside restaurants) on the streets. Your packaging and everything will be different. And then people are always wowed when they see it’s a guy. Some will say “we just felt cooking was for women “ so it gives me an edge compared to others.</p>
									<p><h6>WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WORK WITH A SET OF YOUNG MEN, CAN YOU TELL US THE NUMBER OF MEN YOU WORK WITH, THEIR AGE RANGE AND HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO BRING THEM TOGETHER TO WORK WITH YOU</h6></p>
									<p>Most of them are students and NYSC corp members, and I run an online kitchen so I have a wider range all over the country, I have part-time workers in Calabar, Port-Harcourt, Jos, Kaduna and in Abuja.</p>
									<p>I was in Jos for a wedding some weeks back, so I picked few persons that showed interest to work, it almost feels like a volunteer job but at the end of the day, they get paid at least three thousand naira per day. So if you have a three-day event you are going home with nine thousand naira for just a few hours. Often time I pick them from social media because that’s were most youths spend their time, 8–10 hours a day they could be online. So I know if I have an advert up and say “looking for people to serve at an event” a number of persons signify interest and I select from there.</p>
									<p><h6>THERE’S THIS PARTICULAR EVENT YOU DID FOR COCA-COLA YOUTH EMPOWERMENT, WE NOTICED THAT THEY WERE ABOUT FOUR MEN WORKING, HOW DID YOU GET THEM?</h6></p>
									<p>I got them from social media and then few just passed out from NYSC and I asked them, “would you be able to do this?” and they said yes.</p>
									<p>I actually needed just five people for the job but I had close to thirty- five entries, some people volunteered to do for free, some came from Jos, Ibadan, Port-Harcourt, Abuja.</p>
									<p>Their names are Paul from Jos, Emmanuel from Ibadan, Joe and Cyril from Abuja. Most of them are people within and from far.</p>
									<p><h6>DO YOU COVER FOR THEIR LOGISTICS AND ACCOMMODATION?</h6></p>
									<p>Yes, I do, if you are coming from a very far place and I have tried working with you before and I’m impressed and I don’t want you to feel discouraged because sometimes the Nigeria factor, the money doesn’t have value. I try to foot the transportation to and fro, I even provide an accommodation just to make them feel very comfortable and understand how to do things.</p>
									<p>I keep telling them, you never can tell someday, where you will be after school, instead of looking for a job, you could start something for yourself.</p>
									<p><h6>WHERE ARE YOU BASED?</h6></p>
									<p>I am based in Kaduna but I am hardly there nowadays because most times I have jobs to do outside Kaduna</p>
									<p><h6>WHAT’S YOUR ADVICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY MEN WHO HAVE THIS PASSION TO COOK?</h6></p>
									<p>My advice would be to follow your passion. Passion is what will sustain you in an economy where everything looks frustrating and challenging but when you do it with joy, you never can tell who is eating your food and then your big day would come. Most of these eateries that we see, they all started from somewhere, so if you are good, you would know especially when you are been complimented at home, it is an indication that you have one or two skills that you should develop yourself and lastly, don’t feel inferior, no, you should be proud that you can do this.</p>
									<p><h6>HOW OLD ARE YOU?</h6></p>
									<p>I am thirty</p>
									<p><h6>HOW LONG HAS THIS BRAND BEEN?</h6></p>
									<p>Timsley’s kitchen, this is the second year, we started on the 2nd of July</p>
									<P><h6>Do you mind us speaking with any of your staff</h6></P>
									<p>Go ahead! Please speak to Emmanuel and Joseph.</p>
									<p><h6>WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE A STAFF OF THIS CATERING FIRM, CAN YOU PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF</h6></p>
									<p>I am Joseph Akunde, I used to stay in Kano. After school, I decided to move to Abuja. I served in Kaduna and after service, instead of going around looking for a job, I decided to join my friend in the catering business and it’s been good so far</p>
									<p><h6>HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT COOKING</h6></p>
									<p>Yes actually! I have always loved the idea of cooking as a child. I try a lot of things when I am alone and they come out nice, I also cook for my friends and they appreciate it, they admire it. I’ve always been very passionate about cooking</p>
									<p><h6>ARE YOU A GRADUATE?</h6></p>
									<p>Yes , I am a graduate , I finished from Ambrose Ali University and studied political science.</p>
									<p><h6>HOW OLD ARE YOU?</h6></p>
									<p>I was 27, August 19, 2019</p>
									<p><h6>HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO STAY COMFORTABLE COOKING AS A MAN?</h6></p>
									<p>Well, in the Nigeria of today, anything goes. Does it put food on my table? Yes. Am I happy doing it? Yes. And that is what matters, I really don’t care what anybody thinks or have to say about it . It feeds me, it feeds my family and most importantly, I am happy.</p>
									<p><h6>KINDLY SHARE A WORD OF ADVISE TO YOUNG PEOPLE , ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT COOKING</h6></p>
									<p>If you have passion for anything, I think you should go for it, irrespective of what anybody thinks or says. It might not make sense just yet but go ahead.</p>
									<p>If you are from a privileged family where your parents have money, you have to understand it’s for them, they worked for it. So I think whatever good work you need to do to make yourself happy to get your own money and make you feel independent, do it. Whatever anybody has to say against it, doesn't matter.</p>
									<p><h6>WHERE DO YOURSELF IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS</h6></p>
									<p>In the next five to ten years, I hope to own a very big eatery where you have intercontinental dishes. With time I intend to professionalise my craft, like travel out, learn a lot of stuff, come back and established myself. So, hopefully, in five years from now, I should own two to three big eateries in three different cities apart from Abuja</p>
									<p><h6>What’s your Instagram handle?</h6></p>
									<p>Sparks_brownie</p>
									<p><h6>We will speak with Emmanuel now</h6></p>
									<p><h6>Kindly introduce yourself , your name and what you currently do?</h6></p>
									<p>My name is Emmanuel Onwura. I studied music in the University of Ibadan and I also bake and I am just happy being in the kitchen making food.</p>
									<p><h6>HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT COOKING</h6></p>
									<p>From a very tender age, I can remember way back when I was in primary three or thereabout and my mum never discouraged me from entering the kitchen</p>
									<p><h6>HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO POSITION YOURSELF IN NIGERIA AS A CHEF?</h6></p>
									<p>Actually, for me, it has not been so challenging, because people are always amazed, and say “oh you bake, you cook, wow!, I will like you to do this and that”. I think it kind of puts me on the spotlight whenever I come in contact with someone and I am asked what I do. At that point, they want to know more and that makes them order for events. It is always inspiring.</p>
									<p><h6>HOW OLD ARE YOU?</h6></p>
									<p>I am between 25- 30 years</p>
									<p><h6>HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING WITH THIS CATERING FIRM</h6></p>
									<p>I have been here about two years now</p>
									<p><h6>WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE ESPECIALLY TO MEN THAT HAVE SAME PASSION TO COOK BUT FIND IT CHALLENGING TO SO BECAUSE OF OUR CULTURE</h6></p>
									<p>First, I will say they should be true to themselves because you can’t kill it i.e your passion. It will be there even when you are discouraged, there will still be a particular ground or avenue for you to really show your self and when that opportunity comes , it’s better you make good use of it , that might be a stepping stone, so even if you are from that background just try, don’t let it die , keep doing it as often as possible. When the opportunity finally comes, just give it your best shot .</p>
									<p><h6>WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THIS PROFESSION IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS</h6></p>
									<p>I want to have my personal cake studio, I should also have workers on ground. Students and apprentices in and outside Nigeria working for me.</p>
