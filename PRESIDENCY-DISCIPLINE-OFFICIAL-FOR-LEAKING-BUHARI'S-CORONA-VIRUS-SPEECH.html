									<p class="excert">The presidency has queried an official for allegedly leaking the first draft of President Muhammadu Buhari’s third broadcast on Coronavirus (COVID-19) to the citizens on Monday.</p>
									<p>Buhari had delivered the broadcast which aired on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) at 7 pm on Monday.</p>
									<p>Moments before the president started delivering the prepared speech, a copy which corresponded with the one he was reading out started to circulate online.</p>
								<p>The major dissimilarity in the copy Buhari read out and the one that was leaked was the date the president said the federal government would begin to ease the lockdown in Abuja, Lagos, Ogun State..</p>
								<p>Buhari had said the government would begin to ease the lockdown on May 4, while the leaked copy said May 2.</p>
								<p>The Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said the presidency had identified the official who leaked the draft and that the person, “was already answering for his evil action.”</p>
								<p>He said, “As the country waited for the President with great expectations, a purported copy of the broadcast began to circulate on social media from about 4 p.m. Whodunnit?</p>
								<p>“I took a look at the circulating document, and within one minute, I knew that it was a rogue copy. What immediately gave it away was the paragraphing. It was completely different from the one I had been part of producing, and which had been recorded for broadcast by the President.</p>
								<p>“Another tell-tale to the dubiousness of the document was the date it gave. It said the lockdown in the affected states and the FCT would be eased from May 2, while the authentic copy bore May 4. There were some other discrepancies. Paragraphs that
								had been excised from the final copy were still intact, and the document was riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, which you would rarely find in a presidential broadcast, which would have passed through a number of select and trusted hands.</p>
								<p>“I made a few phone calls to those of us involved with the script, right from origination, which was from outside the Presidency, to final editing, which I did, and the conclusion was easy to reach. Somebody had spirited out the original draft, which had
								gone through many stages of fine-tuning in terms of content and language, and thinking that it was a world exclusive in terms of artifice and underhand action, he fed it into the social media.</p>
								<p>“Who would do such a thing, except an Enemy of the State, someone who wants to ridicule the government, cause utmost confusion in the polity, and smirk his lips in malevolent pleasure, as the government, and possibly the media handlers
									   of the President were flagellated, and taken to the cleaners.</p>
								<p>Refreshing to the official, Adesina said: “Some people hate their own country, and ironically would be the first to complain that things were not going well. Every act of the government (any government) they would undermine.</p>	
								<p>“If they can stick a knife into the soft underbelly of government in any way, they do it with relish, and would be the first to grumble that things were not going right. Enemies of the State.</p>
							    <p>“If the person that leaked the unedited draft of the broadcast had access to more sensitive national documents, he would do the same thing. If he cottons on information that could sell Nigeria to
								the enemy, ho would gladly do it. Thou art in the midst of foes, watch and pray,” he said.</p>
